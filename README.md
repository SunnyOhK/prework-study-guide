# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was created as a preparatory assignment for Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp. It contains introductory notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. After completing this project, I have gained high-level coding skills that will serve as a jumping-off point for a deeper coding education.
