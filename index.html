        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>Visible HTML elements include text, image, header, and list elements.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage. These elements are not visible to a website visitor.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Semantic HTML elements indicate the role of the content and give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
          <li>Heading elements vary in size with h1 being the largest.</li>
          <li>Header elements appear at the top of the page and usually contain a navigation menu and introductory content.</li>
          <li>Footer elements appear at the bottom of the page and usually contain the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>CSS defines the color, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization of a webpage.</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS: Inline CSS, Internal CSS Style Sheet, and External CSS Style Sheet.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns refers to separating code based on use.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules will apply. If you want to apply a rule to all visible elements on a webpage, you can use a <i>wild card symbol</i>.</li>
          <li>A declaration defines the rules to be applied in the form Property: Value.</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code by combining selectors into a single CSS rule.</li>

        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with a website by powering it with effects, interactivity, data communication, and more.</li>
          <li>JS files are linked within the body element <i>after</i> the footer.</li>
          <li>A variable is the named containter that allows us to store a string (or list) of items in our code.</li>
          <li>The control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script. In JS, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>Order of code affects the outcome in JS!</li>
          <li>Conditional statements and loops interrupt the control flow and help control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data (usually related in some way).</li>
          <li>The index refers to the position of a regular expression match within a string. The first item in an array will be assigned an index of 0, and each subsequent item in the array will have an index of a whole number increased by 1.</li>
          <li>A loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all items within an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. To designate how many times a block of code will be executed, developers can use a built-in property of an array named "length."</li>
          <li>Commenting out code is a way to mark certain lines of code as "inactive" without deleting it (just in case you need it later).</li>
